# Contacts-App
Here in this project we have used multiple packages like:-
a.react-navigation:- this is used to create a structure for navigator to create navigation structure in our app.
b.react-navigation/stack:- this is used to provide a way for transition of screens.
c.react-native-contacts:- as we are making an contacts app so this is to access, read, write the contacts.
d.react-native-vector-icons:- it is used beacuse we are using icons in our project.
